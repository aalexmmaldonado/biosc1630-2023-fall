# RAND shopping study

I have several friends that work at [RAND](https://www.rand.org/).
It is a research organization that develops solutions to public policy challenges to help make communities worldwide safer, more secure, healthier, and more prosperous.
RAND is nonprofit, nonpartisan, and committed to the public interest.

They are currently running a study on [young adults' purchasing habits in convenience stores](https://www.rand.org/well-being/community-health-and-environmental-policy/projects/convenience-store-project/participate/store-study-adult.html).
If you are between 21 and 29 years old, you could be eligible to complete the study and be compensated for your time and effort with $100 gift cards.

For more information, please fill out [this survey](https://www.rand.org/well-being/community-health-and-environmental-policy/projects/convenience-store-project/participate/store-study-adult.html) to start the process.
You will be sent a link to take the online screening survey.
If you are eligible, you will be invited to the study center in Oakland.

Even just filling out the initial screening survey is beneficial for their study.

If you submit the interest survey, add the following sentence to the message: "Hey Grace, Alex M. sent me!".
