<h2>D1 - Skills for computational biologists<a class="headerlink" href="#d1-skills-for-computational-biologists" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<section id="id2">
<h3>Rationale<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Computational biology is a rapidly growing field that requires a diverse set of skills.
Technical skills such as programming and data analysis are essential for working with large datasets and developing computational models.
However, soft skills such as communication at various levels of detail and collaboration are essential for working effectively in interdisciplinary teams.</p>
</section>
<section id="id3">
<h3>Content<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Open up a <a class="reference external" href="https://app.tophat.com">Top Hat</a> discussion question and prompt the students to submit what skills should a successful computational biologist have.
Make the responses pop-up on the screen with anonymous mode turned on.
As answers are submitted, the instructor should discuss these aspects and add context.
Encourage for everyone to submit something as this will contribute to their participation grade.</p>
<p>After there is a lull in responses, move forward with slides that discuss what the instructor believes are important skills to have.</p>
<section id="hard-skills">
<h4>Hard skills<a class="headerlink" href="#hard-skills" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Hard skills are technical abilities or knowledge specific to a particular field.
They can be learned through education, training, or on-the-job experience.</p>

</section>
<section id="characteristics-of-effective-feedback">
<h4>Characteristics of effective feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#characteristics-of-effective-feedback" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Effective feedback is a cornerstone of successful learning in computational biology, as it plays a pivotal role in guiding students toward improvement and growth.
To ensure that feedback serves its intended purpose, adhering to several guiding principles is crucial.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted and concise</strong></p>
<p>One common pitfalls in providing feedback is overwhelming authors with excessive information.
While it’s natural to want to cover every aspect of their work, an overflow of feedback can lead to confusion and make it difficult for them to know where to begin.
Identifying and communicating two to four main areas for improvement is advisable.
By distilling your feedback to these core points, you help them focus their efforts on the most crucial aspects.
This approach prevents them from feeling overwhelmed and provides a clear roadmap for their revision process.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment with objectives</strong></p>
<p>Feedback should always be tailored to the author’s main points to communicate to the audience.
Rather than offering generic advice, link your feedback to the stated goals of the task.
By making these connections, you can better focus on how your feedback contributes to their objectives.
This alignment fosters a deeper understanding of the material and encourages students to engage with the content thoughtfully.</p>
<p><strong>Action-oriented guidance</strong></p>
<p>The essence of effective feedback lies in its actionable nature.
Rather than solely identifying flaws, provide the author with clear and specific suggestions for revision.
Highlight particular sections or elements within their work that could benefit from refinement and offer guidance on addressing those areas.
This guidance should be tangible and practical as a step-by-step roadmap to enhance the work.</p>
<p><strong>Timely feedback iterations</strong></p>
<p>Feedback must improve effectiveness when provided too close to the final submission deadline.
Be conscious of how much time the author can incorporate your feedback.
Proposing large, substantial changes would not be productive for the author because they may not have enough time.
Instead, establish a feedback loop that allows authors ample time to engage with your comments and make revisions.
Frequent feedback opportunities before the deadline create an iterative process where they can progressively refine their work.
This ongoing engagement facilitates improvements in the specific assignment and nurtures a deeper understanding of the subject matter over time.</p>

<h4>Advanced search techniques<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-search-techniques" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>How you use the search bar can dramatically impact the quality of the search results.
For example, you must carefully choose keywords that are not too restrictive or broad.
Advanced searching techniques can be used to find articles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use boolean operators like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AND</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OR</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NOT</span></code>;</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">"</span> <span class="pre">"</span></code> operator makes sure that the exact phrase is present;</p></li>
<li><p>Specify a number range like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2004..2007</span></code>;</p></li>
<li><p>Similar words can be specified with a preceding <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~</span></code>;</p></li>
<li><p>A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> wildcard can be used as a fill-in-the-blank;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By strategically combining these techniques, researchers enhance the precision and relevance of their search results.</p>

<h4>Critical evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#critical-evaluation" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The critical evaluation of scientific literature holds paramount importance for researchers seeking to leverage the power of data analysis and computational techniques in biological research.
As you navigate this multidisciplinary field, applying a discerning approach to assess the credibility and relevance of the sources you encounter is essential.</p>
<p>Begin your evaluation by scrutinizing the expertise and credentials of the authors.
Look for authors with a solid foundation in biology and computational methods, as this dual expertise is vital for conducting meaningful research in this field.
Each author does not have to have these skills individually, but all authors jointly should cover all relevant topics.
Examine their academic qualifications and affiliations with renowned institutions, as these factors often correlate- with the quality of research presented.</p>
<p>Publication information is a key factor in evaluating the timeliness and applicability of the information.
Given the rapidly evolving nature of biology and computational methods, ensure that the article’s publication date aligns with the current state of knowledge.
Moreover, it would be best if you were still skeptical of journals with a strong reputation for rigorous peer review and editorial standards.
While these journals advertise that methodologies and analyses are the highest quality, there can still be some issues.
You should be more skeptical of journals with low reputations or no peer review.
I am not saying that these articles are bad, but that sometimes the criteria for publication are less stringent.</p>
<p>Research methods play a pivotal role in computational biology research.
Evaluate the study’s research design, paying particular attention to the integration of computational methods with biological questions.
Assess the sample size, experimental design, simulation parameters, appropriate implementation of algorithms, data collection, and analysis.
A well-designed study should effectively combine computational tools with biological insights to yield robust and relevant results.</p>
<p>As you delve into the results and interpretation of a computational biology study, seek a clear presentation of data, appropriate statistical analyses, and insightful interpretation.
The visualizations and computational models should facilitate a deeper understanding of complex biological phenomena.
Consider the significance of the results in the broader biological context.
Do the computational findings align with established biological principles and provide new insights that advance our understanding?</p>
<p>References and citations serve as a foundation for the credibility of a computational biology study.
Examine the range and quality of sources cited, including computational and biological references.
Well-supported arguments draw on various reputable sources, such as peer-reviewed computational journals, biological databases, and interdisciplinary works.
Additionally, take note of the study’s impact within the computational biology community by assessing the frequency of citations by other researchers.</p>
<p>Peer review remains a cornerstone of credible scientific research, including computational biology.
While peer-reviewed articles undergo evaluation by experts in both computational methods and biology, remember that this process doesn’t eliminate all potential sources of error.
Furthermore, the replication of computational findings by independent researchers is a testament to the robustness of the methods and results.
In this dynamic field, staying attuned to potential conflicts of interest is vital, as they could influence the computational analyses or interpretations.</p>
<p>Lastly, consider the clarity of the writing and the accessibility of complex computational concepts.
A well-written computational biology article should communicate intricate computational methodologies and their biological implications effectively.
Striking a balance between technical terminology and broader accessibility ensures that the research can be understood and applied by researchers from various backgrounds.</p>
