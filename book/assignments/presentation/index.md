# Presentation

Students will give an informative, story-telling presentation about their selected focus paper and directly support [Course Outcome C9](course-outcomes).
The purpose of these presentations is to practice communicating science effectively and for the instructor to probe your understanding of the paper and critical thinking on the fly.

- The presentation needs to be at least 15 minutes and a maximum of 25 minutes.
- Each presenter will have at least five minutes of questions from the audience, including the instructor.
- Each presenter will be in front of the class for 30 minutes.
Your question and answer portion will fill up whatever remaining time you have after presenting.
Thus, the shorter the presentation, the more questions you will get from the audience.

## Makeups

I acknowledge that ~~some~~ most people are not comfortable presenting.
It took me years to improve, but I still get anxious before every presentation.
Unfortunately, the department requires that there be a presentation component of the course.

If any student receives 20 points or lower, I will offer an opportunity to recover 50% of the points they lost.
For example, if you originally had 10 points, then the makeup activity could bring your grade back up to 20.

The makeup activity will entail having a 30-minute discussion with the instructor about your paper.
You do not need to update, change, or make slides for this discussion.
You will be asked to summarize your focus paper, and then the instructor will ask you any related questions.
This activity will have to occur within two weeks of your original presentation.
