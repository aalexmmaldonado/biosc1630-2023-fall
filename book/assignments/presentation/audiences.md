# Know your audience

Before starting to make any presentation, the first thing you need to do is characterize your audience.
This helps you identify your presentation's goals, what content to add, and what jargon to use.
Below, you can find some descriptions and examples of different audiences.

For your class presentation, aim for the [intermediate level](presentation:audience:intermediate).

(presentation:audience:peer)=
## Peer

The target audience consists of people with similar backgrounds in scientific research.
The presenter can assume a strong understanding of the field's fundamentals among the audience.
As a result, the content should focus on the specific details of the paper, including in-depth explanations of methodologies, results, and their implications.
The use of specialized terminology is not only permissible but expected as long as it is widely accepted.
In-depth technical explanations, suitable for experts in the field, should characterize the presentation style.
Encouraging critical discussions and questions is vital, as it's a chance to engage with peers on a highly technical level.

- **Scientific Conferences:** Presenting research findings to experts in the field.
- **Research Group Meetings:** Sharing detailed updates on ongoing projects with fellow researchers.
- **Academic Seminars:** Addressing faculty and graduate students in a specialized department.
- **Journal Club:** Discussing advanced research papers with colleagues.
- **Thesis or Dissertation Defense:** Presenting to a committee of experts in the research area.
- **Research Collaboration Meetings:** Sharing technical details with collaborators.

(presentation:audience:intermediate)=
## Intermediate

The audience understands your general research but is not necessarily experts.
The content should strike a balance between providing technical details and explanations.
It's important to introduce fundamental concepts and terminologies but avoid overwhelming the audience with overly complex jargon.
Clearly summarizing methods and results is crucial.
The presentation style should involve providing context and explanations where necessary.
Allow for a more accessible approach while still diving into the paper's specifics.

:::{admonition} Examples

- **Undergraduate Research Symposium:** Presenting research to fellow undergraduates and faculty members.
- **Industry Conferences:** Addressing professionals with some field knowledge but not necessarily experts.
- **Graduate-Level Course Presentations:** Explaining complex topics to classmates with varying backgrounds.
- **Research Proposal Presentations:** Pitching a research idea to a mixed audience.
- **Company-Wide Meetings:** Presenting to colleagues from various departments.
- **Technical Workshops:** Teaching technical concepts to diverse participants.

(presentation:audience:introductory)=
## Introductory

This presentation caters to people with limited exposure to your field.
The audience is assumed to need more prior knowledge of the subject.
Presentations should begin with fundamental concepts and offer comprehensive background information.
Avoid using technical jargon as much as possible and instead focus on conveying the broader significance.
The presentation style should use simple language, visuals, and analogies to explain complex concepts, ensuring that everyone can follow along.

:::{admonition} Examples

- **High School Science Fairs:** Explaining scientific concepts to a non-specialist audience.
- **Outreach Programs:** Engaging with students or the public in science communication.
- **Layperson Workshops:** Teaching basic scientific principles to those without a scientific background.
- **Elevator Pitches to Investors:** Simplifying complex technology for potential investors.
- **Public Talks at Science Museums:** Sharing the excitement of science with a general audience.
- **General Audience Webinars:** Discussing scientific topics with attendees from various backgrounds.

(presentation:audience:hybrid)=
## Hybrid

The audience has a wide range of backgrounds in your field.
It would be best if you struck a balance between providing essential context and detailed technical information.
Offer a brief overview of the paper's significance, then move into a more in-depth analysis of key points.
The presentation style should be adaptable, with the ability to gauge the audience's understanding and adjust the level of detail on the fly.

:::{admonition} Examples

- **Interdisciplinary Conferences:** Presenting to an audience comprising experts from different fields, requiring a balance of technical details and broad explanations.
- **Cross-Departmental Meetings:** Sharing research findings with colleagues from various departments within an institution necessitates presentation style adaptability.
- **Research Consortium Meetings:** Presenting in a collaborative research environment, where participants have varying levels of expertise.
- **Scientific Outreach to Local Schools:** Explaining complex scientific concepts to students with differing levels of familiarity with the topic.
- **Industry Seminars for Mixed Teams:** Addressing employees with diverse backgrounds and technical knowledge in a corporate setting.
- **Pitching to Potential Collaborators:** Engaging with potential research or business partners who may have different levels of expertise in your field.

(presentation:audience:public)=
## General public

When delivering a presentation to a general public audience, assume that the listeners have no background in your field.
Begin with a fundamental introduction to the field, and do not use technical jargon or complex terminology.
The focus should be on explaining the broader implications and significance of the paper in simple and relatable terms, making it accessible to a non-specialist audience.
Incorporate plain language, clear visuals, and relatable analogies to simplify complex concepts.
Encourage questions for clarification, but keep the discussion at a broad, conceptual level.
In this context, the goal is to engage and inform the audience while sparking their interest in the subject matter without delving into technical specifics.

:::{admonition} Examples

- **Public Talks and Lectures:** Addressing a broad audience at community events.
- **TED Talks:** Delivering compelling talks to engage and inspire a diverse audience.
- **Science Caf√©s:** Communicating science in a casual, accessible manner to the public.
- **Media Interviews:** Presenting scientific concepts to a mass audience through television, radio, or podcasts.
- **Public Demonstrations:** Showing the practical applications of science to a general audience.
- **Educational YouTube Channels:** Creating content that simplifies complex ideas for online viewers.
