# Presentation rubric

This rubric is how the instructor will evaluate student presentations.
Each criterion has four ratings:

- **Satisfactory:**
  This rating indicates that the work meets the acceptable standards.
- **Room for improvement:**
  The work could benefit from further refinement, additional details, or improved execution.
- **Insufficient:**
  The work does not meet the basic requirements and requires substantial revisions or corrections.
- **Absent:**
  No evaluation of the work is possible (i.e., missing).

The following categories also represent the recommended general flow of your presentation.
