:class: dropdown
Students presenting on October 18, 2023, will have an optional one-week extension (i.e., due October 25).
However, doing this first draft assignment will provide a good outline for your presentation.
:::


## Objective

Before turning in a complete draft of your paper, you will turn in an outline/partial draft.
Making a full outline helps you:

- plan what needs to be written;
- see the flow of your paper;
- identify knowledge or content gaps.

## Grading

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria.
Each criterion has four ratings:

- **Satisfactory:**
  This rating indicates that the work meets the acceptable standards.
- **Room for improvement:**
  The work would benefit from some refinement, additional details, or improved execution.
- **Insufficient:**
  The work does not meet the basic requirements and requires substantial revisions or corrections.
- **Absent:**
  No evaluation of the work is possible (i.e., missing).

## Instructions

:::{tip}
At this point, we are at the drafting stage.
Your aim for this assignment should not be crafting well-written sentences but to get words and thoughts on the page.
In later assignments, you can restructure and polish them in the writing and editing stage.
