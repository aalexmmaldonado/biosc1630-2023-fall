# Paper guidelines

## Typesetting

A [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com) template will be shared with you with approved typesetting.

- **Page:** Use standard letter-sized paper (8.5" x 11").
  Set margins to 1 inch on all sides.
- **Font:** Use a legible font such as Times New Roman, Arial, Roboto, etc.
  Use a 12 pt font size for all normal text except headings, which should be 14 pt.
- **Spacing:** Use 1.5 spacing for the entire document, including the main text, headings, and references.
- **Paragraphs:** Align text to the left margin (i.e., ragged right).
  There should be a blank line between paragraphs with no indent.
- **Headings:** Headings should be 14 pt, centered, concise, and bolded.
  Subheadings should be 12 pt, bolded, and aligned to the left margin.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in font usage, heading styles, spacing, and formatting throughout the document.

## Contents

Students will write and revise a review paper (7--9 pages, 1.5 spacing, 1” margins, 12-point font) centered on a primary literature article of their choosing.
Students will put their focus article it into context by using at least two more primary literature articles.
The review will include:

- significant background about the computational and biological questions being investigated,
- the current state of knowledge about the topic,
- a discussion of critical experiments leading to our understanding,
- and suggestions for future work.

### Cover Page

- The title page should present the review’s title, your name, course title, version (`Draft 1`,
`Draft 2`, `Final Paper`), and the date of the paper.
- The title page is not numbered but is considered to be page 1 of the entire document;
however, it does not count towards the 7--9 page text requirement.

### Introduction

- The introduction of your paper begins on page 2 of the document.
  (However, the page number should show `1`.)
- Place a heading (`Introduction`) above the first sentence of this section.
- The introduction establishes the entire document's purpose, relevance, and direction.
- At the end of the introduction, you should explicitly state what you will do in your paper.
- Length of introduction should be 1--2 pages.

(paper:format:body)=
### Body

- This section should be split into sections starting with a heading.
- Body should follow directly the last paragraph of your introduction rather than start a
new page.
- You may use subheadings if necessary.
- You should present and discuss key methods, data, and analysis.
  No additional context/motivation of the research should be included at the beginning; that still belongs in the introduction.
- Include unifying themes or overarching results, weaknesses, gaps, or inconsistencies so
that you are not simply summarizing papers.

### Conclusions

- This section should be preceded by a heading (`Conclusions`).
- Conclusions should immediately follow your last paragraph of the body rather than start a
new page.
- Summarize unifying themes and over-arching results from the evidence presented above.
- Summarize any weaknesses, gaps, or potential inconsistencies.
- Suggest future directions of the research.
- Length of conclusions should be 0.5--1 page.

### References

- Place your references starting on a new page after the conclusions with a `References` heading.
- Use the [author–date citation system](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/author-date) in the [APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references).
- References should be sorted alphabetically and not numbered.
- Pages do not count towards the 7--9 page text requirement.
- Every reference must have a DOI.
  This excludes most webpages unless they are archived and version controlled.

### Tables and Figures

- A sample figure is included at the end of the template.
- Only have one table or figure per page.
- Tables are placed first and sequentially numbered; then figures are placed last and
sequentially numbered.
  For example, `Table 1`, `Table 2`, `Figure 1`, etc.
- Pages do not count towards the 7--9 page text requirement.
- If the table or figure is from an article, include the original figure legend and place it within a textbox with a border.
- You do not necessarily have to include the entire table or figure (e.g., you might show Panel A of the original figure).
- Write your own figure legend, placing it outside of the box.
- Make sure to cite the reference in the caption.

## Style

Your paper should cater to the [intermediate audience](presentation:audience:intermediate).

Everyone has their own preferred style of writing.
While many things are subject to taste, there are still some suggested guidelines one should follow when possible.

```{note}
This is a work in progress.
```

- Avoid using `I` in your writing whenever possible.
  There is almost always a better way to write the sentence without `I`, `we`, `us`, `you`, etc.
  However, if you must use one of them, `we` is preferred.
- Citations should always go before the period (i.e., left) instead of after.
  In-text citations are treated as part of the sentence.
  When writing for a scientific journal, you follow whatever their guidelines state.
- For every sentence, ask yourself how a grumpy old scientist would respond.

  > Computational biology is revolutionizing our understanding of the world around us.

  A grumpy scientist could think, "Oh, good, like I didn't already know this and read five papers with this same introduction."
  Use this to guide if your statement is too broad.
- When listing items with `(1)`, `(a)`, etc. make sure to add a `,` or `;`.
  For example, there is something to (a) show, (b) tell, (c) and see.
- The [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) is strongly recommended.
- Avoid absolute or general statements like "best", "worst", "wrong", "only", etc. when someone could make an argument about some other approach being superior.
  For example, instead of

  > We chose to use the ff19SB force field because it is the best for our system.

  You can say,

  > Our MD simulations employed the ff19SB force field because previous publications [8, 9] have demonstrated its high performance for similar proteins.

  Instead of saying,

  > Molecular dynamics is the best method.

  you can say,

  > Molecular dynamics has shown promising results in similar studies.
- It is important to have variety in your sentence structure and length.
  For example, have some short sentences, some longer ones, use semicolons, em dashes, etc.
  Variety makes it easier to read and maintain focus.
- Minimize the amount of jumping around the reader has to do to follow your paper.
  For example, do not include a glossary at the end of your paper for technical terms.
  Explain them concisely in your writing.
