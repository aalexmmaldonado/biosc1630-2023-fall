# Paper format guidelines

## Typesetting

A [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com) template will be shared with you with approved typesetting.

- **Page:** Use standard letter-sized paper (8.5" x 11").
  Set margins to 1 inch on all sides.
- **Font:** Use a legible font such as Times New Roman, Arial, Roboto, etc.
  Use a 12 pt font size for all normal text except headings, which should be 14 pt.
- **Spacing:** Use 1.5 spacing for the entire document, including the main text, headings, and references.
- **Paragraphs:** Align text to the left margin (i.e., ragged right).
  There should be a blank line between paragraphs with no indent.
- **Headings:** Headings should be 14 pt, centered, concise, and bolded.
  Subheadings should be 12 pt, bolded, and aligned to the left margin.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in font usage, heading styles, spacing, and formatting throughout the document.

## Cover Page

- The title page should present the review’s title, your name, course title, version (`Draft 1`,
`Draft 2`, `Final Paper`), and the date of the paper.
- The title page is not numbered but is considered to be page 1 of the entire document;
however, it does not count towards the 7--9 page text requirement.

## Introduction

- The introduction of your paper begins on page 2 of the document.
  (However, the page number should show `1`.)
- Place a heading (`Introduction`) above the first sentence of this section.
- The introduction establishes the entire document's purpose, relevance, and direction.
- At the end of the introduction, you should explicitly state what you will do in your paper.
- Length of introduction should be 1--2 pages.

(paper:format:body)=
## Body

- This section should be split into sections starting with a heading.
- Body should follow directly the last paragraph of your introduction rather than start a
new page.
- You may use subheadings if necessary.
- You should present and discuss key data.
- Include unifying themes or overarching results, weaknesses, gaps, or inconsistencies so
that you are not simply summarizing papers.

## Conclusions

- This section should be preceded by a heading (`Conclusions`).
- Conclusions should immediately follow your last paragraph of the body rather than start a
new page.
- Summarize unifying themes and over-arching results from the evidence presented above.
- Summarize any weaknesses, gaps, or potential inconsistencies.
- Suggest future directions of the research.
- Length of conclusions should be 0.5--1 page.

## References

- Place your references starting on a new page after the conclusions with a `References` heading.
- Use the [author–date citation system](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/author-date) in the [APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references).
- Pages do not count towards the 7--9 page text requirement.

## Tables and Figures

- A sample figure is included at the end of the template.
- Only have one table or figure per page.
- Tables are placed first and sequentially numbered; then figures are placed last and
sequentially numbered.
  For example, `Table 1`, `Table 2`, `Figure 1`, etc.
- Pages do not count towards the 7--9 page text requirement.
- If the table or figure is from an article, include the original figure legend and place it within a textbox with a border.
- You do not necessarily have to include the entire table or figure (e.g., you might show Panel A of the original figure).
- Write your own figure legend, placing it outside of the box.
- Make sure to cite the reference in the caption.
