## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to help students develop the skills necessary to identify and propose relevant scientific articles in the field of computational biology that will serve as the basis for their upcoming literature review and presentation.

## Instructions

In this assignment, your task is to identify and select three distinct scientific articles within computational biology.
These chosen articles will be the primary focal points for your upcoming literature review and presentation.

For each selected article, provide a concise rationale, approximately 150-200 words, explaining the reasoning behind your choice.
This rationale should include

- the article's significance within the realm of computational biology,
- its potential contribution to your comprehension of the subject matter,
- and a brief yet informative summary detailing the article's primary research question or objective.

As a final component of this assignment, propose an additional primary literature article cited within your chosen article for each of the three selections.
Briefly summarize the relevance of these secondary articles in a few sentences, elucidating how they can provide essential context and background information about your primary selections.
This will further enrich your understanding of the chosen topics and contribute to the depth of your literature review and presentation.

## Submission

You may write in a word processer of your choice: [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), [typst](https://typst.app/), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/), [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), [WPS Office](https://www.wps.com/), etc.
However, you must submit your assignment as a PDF in [Canvas](https://canvas.pitt.edu/).

## Formatting

Here are the guidelines for formatting your writing.

- **Page:** Use standard letter-sized paper (8.5" x 11").
  Set margins to 1 inch on all sides.
- **Font:** Use a legible font such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri.
  Use a font size of 12 points for all text.
- **Spacing:** Use 1.5 spacing for the entire document, including the main text, headings, and references.
- **Paragraphs:** Align text to the left margin (ragged right).
  There should be a blank line between paragraphs.
- **Headings:** Headings should be concise and bolded.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in font usage, heading styles, spacing, and formatting throughout the document.
- **Citations:** Any and all citations must be in the APA format.

```{note}
I am being specific in the formatting guidelines so you do not have to make a decision/worry about it.
No points will be deducted if there are deviations from this format, like 0.75" margins or 1.0 spacing.
I will allow you to resubmit the assignment if your submission is unreadable or incomprehensible; otherwise, I will treat it as late.

## Grading

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria.

- **Clarity and thoughtfulness (2.0 points):**
  We will assess how clearly and thoughtfully you explain your rationale for choosing each scientific article and its relevance to computational biology.
  Ensure that your explanations are concise, well-structured, and demonstrate why you made each selection.
- **Identification of key information (1.5 points):**
  This criterion focuses on the completeness and accuracy of the information you provide for each selected article.
  Include the title, authors, publication source (including journal and publication date), and a brief summary of the article's primary research question or objective.
- **Selection of additional literature (1.0 points):**
  We will evaluate the relevance and appropriateness of the additional primary literature articles you suggest for each selected article.
  These additional articles should enhance your understanding by providing valuable context and background information.
  Explain why you believe these secondary articles are pertinent to your primary selections.
- **Grammar and writing quality (0.5 points):**
  This aspect concerns the overall quality of your writing, including grammar, spelling, and sentence structure.
