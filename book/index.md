Topics in computational biology will be explored using primary literature.
Students will present research articles orally and complete a series of writing assignments that will culminate in producing a literature review paper.

## Open education

We value accessible, open education that should be available to anyone who seeks it.
Thus, all materials for this course are released under the [Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) (CC BY-SA 4.0) license.

## Feedback and reflection

[hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) is used to provide feedback, ask questions, and reflect on the course materials.
After making an account, you can annotate using the "Annotation sidebar" on the right-hand side of your screen.

## Building the website

This website is built using the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) framework and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the Python environment.

If you do not have `poetry` installed you can so by activating your preferred Python environment and running the following command:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

Now we have to setup the virtual environment.
Technically, other versions of Python3 should work, but I have not validated it.

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry env use python3.11
make pre-commit-install
```

To build the website:

```bash
make install
make book
```

You can now view the website by opening `book/_build/html/index.html`.

## Contributing

All contributions, corrections, and suggestions are welcome!

We use [pre-commits](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure uniform formatting.
These have to be installed first.

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

Before committing and pushing, run the following command a couple of times to ensure all checks pass.

```bash
make validate
```

## Local copy

You can also get a local copy of this website.
Go to the [repository](https://github.com/aalexmmaldonado/biosc1630-2023-fall) and switch to the [`gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/aalexmmaldonado/biosc1630-2023-fall/tree/gh-pages).
Then click the green `< > Code` button and download a zip file containing an up-to-date compiled website.

Alternatively, you can click [this link](https://github.com/aalexmmaldonado/biosc1630-2023-fall/archive/refs/heads/gh-pages.zip) to automatically download this zip.

## Encryption

[git-secret](https://github.com/sobolevn/git-secret) is used to encrypt course materials that are in preparation.
Use [`git secret add`](https://sobolevn.me/git-secret/git-secret-add) to encrypt an untracked file.
This will add a line to `.gitignore` and `.gitsecret/paths/mapping.cfg` to mark that it should be a `.secret` file.
To stop encrypting the file, remove the lines in `.gitignore` and `.gitsecret/paths/mapping.cfg` and delete the `.secret` file.

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks are used to ensure all desired files are encrypted before commits.
Building the book before committing is beneficial as it will encrypt and decrypt files as necessary so you can see which files are changing.
`git secret reveal` will allow you to decrypt these files if you have access.

## Hooks

We have added a [`post-merge` hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_post_merge) in `.githooks` that will ensure the encrypted files are handled correctly.
It will create backups of all decrypted files in the local repository if they exist.
Then, it will decrypt the `.secret` files to ensure the unencrypted files are consistent.

You must run the following command while in the repository to use these hooks.

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
