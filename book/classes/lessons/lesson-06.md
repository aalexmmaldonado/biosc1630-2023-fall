:::{tab-item} What do you critically analyze?
In a critical analysis, you do not express your opinions or views.
You need to develop your thesis, position, or stance on the topic from the views and research of others.
In academic writing, you critically analyze other researchers’:

- theories
- concepts, terms
- viewpoints, arguments, positions
- methodologies, approaches
- research results and conclusions

This means weighing up the strength of the arguments or research support on the topic and deciding who or what has the more robust weight of evidence or support.

Therefore, your thesis argues, with evidence, why a particular theory, concept, viewpoint, methodology, or research result(s) is/are stronger, more sound, or more advantageous than others.
:::

:::{tab-item} What does ‘analysis’ mean?
Critical analysis means analyzing or breaking down the parts of the literature and grouping these into themes, patterns, or trends.

In an analysis, you need to:

- Identify and separate the parts of the topic by grouping the various fundamental theories, central concepts, the main arguments or ideas, and the key research results and conclusions on the topic into themes, patterns, or trends of agreement, dispute, and omission.
- Discuss each of these parts by explaining:
  - the areas of agreement/consensus or similarity
  - the issues or controversies: in dispute or debate, areas of difference
  - the omissions, gaps, or areas that are under-researched
- Discuss the relationship between these parts
- Examine how each contributes to the whole topic
- Make conclusions about their significance or importance in the topic
:::

:::{tab-item} What does ‘critical’ mean?
Critical analysis does not mean writing angry, rude, or disrespectful comments or expressing your views in judgmental terms of black and white, good and bad, or right and wrong.

To be critical or to critique means to evaluate. Therefore, to write critically in an academic analysis means to:

- judge the quality, significance, or worth of the theories, concepts, viewpoints, methodologies, and research results
- evaluate in a fair and balanced manner
- avoid extreme or emotional language

You evaluate or judge the quality, significance, or worth by examining the:

- strengths, advantages, benefits, gains, or improvements
- disadvantages, weaknesses, shortcomings, limitations, or drawbacks

:::{tab-item} How to critically analyze a theory, model, or framework
The evaluative words used most often to refer to theory, model, or framework are a sound theory or a strong theory.

The table below summarizes the criteria for judging the strengths and weaknesses of a theory:

- comprehensive
- clear
- logical
- practical
- applicable
- empirically supported
- up-to-date
- parsimonious

The following sentences are examples of the phrases used to explain strengths and weaknesses.

> Smith’s (2005) theory appears up-to-date, practical and applicable across many divergent settings.

> Brown’s (2010) theory, although parsimonious and logical, lacks sufficient evidence to support its propositions and predictions ...

> More scientific evidence must be presented to support the premises of this theory.

> One of the limitations with this theory is that it does not explain why ...

> A significant strength of this model is that it takes into account ...

> The propositions of this model appear unambiguous and logical.

> A fundamental problem with this framework is the conceptual inconsistency between ...

:::

:::{tab-item} How to critically analyze a concept
The list below summarizes the criteria for judging the strengths and weaknesses of a concept:

- key variables identified
- clear and well-defined
- meaningful
- logical
- relevant
- up-to-date

Critical analysis examples of concepts

> Many researchers have used the concept of control in different ways.

> There is little consensus about what constitutes automaticity.

> Putting forth a very general definition of motivation means that it is possible that any behavior could be included.

> The concept of global education lacks clarity, is imprecisely defined and is overly complex.

> Some have questioned the usefulness of resilience as a concept because it has been used so often and in many contexts.

> Research suggests that preoperative fasting is an outdated clinical approach.

:::

:::{tab-item} How to critically analyze arguments, viewpoints, or ideas
The table below summarizes the criteria for judging the strengths and weaknesses of an argument, perspective, or idea:

- reasons support the argument
- argument is substantiated by evidence
- evidence for the argument is relevant
- evidence for the argument is unbiased, sufficient, and important
- evidence is reputable
- balanced
- clear
- logical
- convincing
:::

:::{tab-item} How to critically analyze a methodology
The list below provides the criteria for judging the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology.

An evaluation of a methodology usually involves a critical analysis of its main sections:

- design; sampling (participants); measurement tools and materials; procedure
- design tests the hypotheses or research questions
- method valid and reliable
- potential bias or measurement error and confounding variables addressed
- method allows results to be generalized
- a representative sampling of cohort and phenomena; sufficient response rate
- valid and reliable measurement tools
- a valid and reliable procedure
- method clear and detailed to allow replication
:::

:::{tab-item} How to critically analyze research results and conclusions
The list below provides the criteria for judging the strengths and weaknesses of research results and conclusions:

- appropriate choice and use of statistics
- correct interpretation of results
- all results explained
- alternative explanations considered
- significance of all results discussed
- consistency of results with previous research discussed
- results add to existing understanding or knowledge
- limitations discussed
- results clearly explained
- conclusions consistent with results
