### Abstract

This study presents an innovative methodology that integrates machine learning to optimize dessert combinations while considering dynamic factors such as weather, season, and personal characteristics.
The approach encompasses ingredient selection, customer surveys, experimental tastings, data collection, machine learning model training, iterative refinement, cost analysis, pricing strategy development, implementation, and ongoing monitoring.
Since dogs have a better sense of smell, we also include a dog taste tester to improve the robustness of our methodology.

### Methodology

#### Initial ingredient selection

We carefully selected a diverse range of ingredients that form the foundation of our culinary experiment.
This included vanilla ice cream, Liege waffles, chocolate chips, and apricots.
We also included different pancake types, such as buttermilk, whole wheat, and gluten-free.

#### Customer surveys and preferences

After the participant tried a randomly curated dessert, we inquired about the following:

- the flavors that ignite their taste buds;
- the textural qualities they seek in waffles and pancakes (from crispness to fluffiness);
- the levels of sweetness that titillate their palates;
- and the toppings or sauces that elevate their dessert experience.

For the one dog participant, we had them lick a dessert (without any chocolate) and asked them to boop a sign with a thumbs up or down.

We also gathered data on customer characteristics, considering factors such as age, fur length, and favorite color.
We also recorded environmental conditions, weather, and season, as these factors can significantly influence dessert preferences.

#### Machine learning model training

Here, we employ neural networks meticulously trained on our extensive dataset.
Considering the data we collected, these models are designed to predict personalized dessert combinations.
The fusion of data and technology empowers us to offer a dessert experience that resonates with each individual's taste buds, elevating satisfaction to unprecedented levels.
