:::{tab-item} Sampling bias
One potential flaw in the methodology is sampling bias in the customer surveys.
Suppose the surveys are conducted primarily in-store or online. In that case, they may not capture potential customers' preferences who have never visited.
This bias can result in skewed data that only partially represents the broader customer base.
:::

:::{tab-item} Subjective taste evaluations
Relying solely on subjective taste evaluations during the experimental tastings can introduce bias. Tasters may have personal preferences that influence their feedback. Additionally, the panel of experts may not accurately represent the diversity of customer tastes, potentially leading to the dismissal of combinations that could appeal to a broader audience.
:::

:::{tab-item} Limited ingredient selection
The initial ingredient selection may be limited to the owner's or chef's preferences, which can lead to a bias toward certain flavors and combinations.
This bias can hinder creativity and prevent exploring novel ingredients or combinations that customers might enjoy.
:::

:::{tab-item} Small sample size
In the case of taste-testing events, a small sample size of participants may not provide statistically significant data.
This small sample size can lead to unreliable findings and an inaccurate representation of customer preferences.
