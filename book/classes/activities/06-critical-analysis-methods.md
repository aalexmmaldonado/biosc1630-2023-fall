# Critical analysis of methods

**Total duration:** 60+ minutes

## Objective

Critical thinking and analysis in a scientific concept can be challenging to grasp without extensive expertise.
This activity primes students for critically analyzing a (sadly) fictitious study about desserts.

## Form groups

**Duration:** 0 minutes

Groups should already be assigned from [this activity](activity:introduction-moves).

## Section assignment

**Duration:** 2 minutes

Randomly assign groups to subsections of the [materials](examples:article:conclusions).

- Group 1
  - Generation of structural homology-based models
- Group 2
  - Structure-based druggability assessment
- Group 3
  - *L. monocytogenes* metabolic network construction and analysis
- Group 4
  - Essentiality analysis
  - Off-target criteria
- Group 5
  - Analysis of conservation among pathogenic *L. monocytogenes*
- Group 6
  - Expression data of *L. monocytogenes*
- Group 7
  - Target prioritization

## Reading

**Duration:** 13 minutes

Individually, read your group's assigned methodology subsection(s).

## Group discussion

**Duration:** 20 minutes

Now, critically analyze your assigned methodology subsection with your group members.
Use the following questions to guide your discussion.

- Why did the authors do this analysis?
- How do the methods work?
- Are the methods reliable?
- Should the authors have used different techniques?
- Are there any biases introduced from these methods?
- Would you be able to reproduce these results?

Keep in mind that you will share your analysis with the class.

## Presentation preparation

**Duration:** 20 minutes

To share your critical analysis with the class, please prepare a presentation using the assertion-evidence framework.
The quality of the presentation does not matter&mdash;it is just so you can easily communicate your takeaway points and visual guides.
There is no time requirement or limit for your presentation.

## Sharing with the class

**Duration:** Whatever time is left (around 30 minutes?)
